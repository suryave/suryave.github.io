  <p>One of the things I've gotten into recently is programming. I'm currently learning C++, C#, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and how to work with the Unity Engine.</p>
  <p>I've also attended and plan to attend hackathons. My team and I won best game at CodeDay NJ Winter 2015, and I will be going to HackRU Spring 2015, CodeDay NJ Spring 2015, as well as PennApps Winter 2015.</p>
